I'm an Android developer üë®‚Äçüíª currently working at Google as a Developer Relations engineer.

### What I do

As a *Developer Relations (DevRel)* engineer, it's my focus to help improving the Android developer experience. I'm currently focusing on **Kotlin & Coroutines, Jetpack Compose, general app architecture, and dependency injection** (including Dagger and Hilt).

My role can be clearly divided into two main tasks: 

* **Feedback to other teams**. DevRel is the *0th customer* for libraries and framework SDK updates. We're the first ones trying out what's coming next in Android development and deliver feedback accordingly. **Always with the Android community in mind**, I pay attention to API usability and how certain features could be misused, discuss trade offs and alternatives to different solutions, file bugs, etc.

* **Outreach and guidance**. Apart from the content you can find in this website, I contribute with documentation to [developers.android.com](https://developers.android.com), [codelabs](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/), and [code samples](https://github.com/android). I love getting involved with the community by going and speaking in conferences, writing articles, and helping others as much as I can.
